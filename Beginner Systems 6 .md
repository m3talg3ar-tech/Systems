### Key Points

#### Authentication Mechanisms
1. **Password Testing**:
   - The system tested passwords against encrypted versions obtained from `/etc/shadow` (previously using `/etc/passwd`). This process involves rendering judgments on whether the provided password matches the stored, encrypted version.

2. **Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)**:
   - PAM is a shared library that allows integration of authentication routines into login and other programs.
   - By separating authentication functions into discrete subsystems, PAM facilitates easy updates to incorporate new advancements in authentication methods and encryption technologies.

#### Access Control Models
3. **Mandatory Access Control**:
   - Focuses on the confidentiality of data by ensuring strong tranquility properties:
     - Strong: Labels do not change while the system is operating.
     - Weak: Security labels may change but must not conflict with defined security policies to maintain integrity.

4. **Integrity and Confidentiality**:
   - Integrity ensures that bad or unauthorized data cannot be pushed up to higher levels (no write-up) nor accessed by unauthorized actors (no read-down).
   - In the past, commands like `login` included hardwired authentication code for password prompts but have since evolved.

#### Authentication Factors
5. **Something You Know**:
   - Passwords and usernames are examples of this factor.
6. **Something You Have**:
   - Synchronous tokens (e.g., smart cards) or asynchronous tokens like CAC cards fall under this category.
7. **Something You Are**:
   - Biometrics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, etc.

8. **Someplace You Are**:
   - GPS controls can be used for location-based authentication.

#### CIA Triad
9. **Confidentiality**:
    - Ensuring only authorized people have access to data.
10. **Integrity**:
    - Preventing unauthorized modification of information.
11. **Availability**:
    - Guaranteeing that information is accessible when needed.

### References and Additional Information
12. **References on CIA Triad**:
   - The document references the CIA triad (Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability) from TechTarget's definition, emphasizing how these principles apply to data security.
13. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    - References RBAC as an effective method for managing user permissions within a system.

### Historical Context
14. **Historical Authentication Methods**:
   - In the past, commands like `login` included hardwired authentication code that prompted users to enter their passwords.
15. **Evolution of Security Mechanisms**:
    - The document highlights how security mechanisms have evolved from hardcoded methods towards more flexible and secure systems using PAM.
